## Master branch:

> **WARNING**: Do not change anything in the master branch.

## Branches:

- `zee`: Dedicated branch to support all tuning developments for Zee decay and electron triggers higher than 15 GeV for the `FastCalo` step;
- `zee_el`: Dedicated branch to support all tuning developments for Zee decay and electron triggers higher than 15 GeV for the `FastElectron` step;
- `jpsi`: Dedicated branch to support all tuning developments for Jpsiee decay and electron triggers below 15 GeV for the `FastCalo` step;
- `zrad`: Dedicated branch to support all tuning developments for Z radiative decay and photon triggers for the `FastCalo` step.


## Packages:

- `saphyra`: Tuning package used to derive the ringer tunings;
- `kolmov`: Kit to make all corrections and convert the model to ONNX and athena;
- `kepler`: The ringer vectorize analysis kit to test all models;
